## 📖 About

openCv-projects is your sandbox for experimenting with fundamental and fun computer-vision ideas.  
Whether you're just starting out with CV or want quick reference demos, this repo assembles multiple standalone scripts — each illustrating a different concept such as detection, gesture recognition, and interactive real-time control.

## ✅ Features & Projects

| Script | Purpose / Description |
|--------|----------------------|
| `Eyes_detector.py` | Detects and marks eyes in images / webcam feed. |
| `finger_count.py` | Real-time detection & counting of raised fingers (hand-gesture recognition). |
| `volume_control.py` | Control system volume (or any analog value) using hand gesture / movement. |
| `dino_game.py` | Fun demo / interactive application — “dino-game” style. |
| Sample images | `cactus.png`, `dino.png` — sample assets used for testing / demonstration. |

Feel free to build on or combine these examples to create something more advanced.
