# openCv-projects

A collection of small yet useful Computer Vision / image-processing projects written in Python using OpenCV. Great for learning and experimenting with different CV tasks — from simple image manipulation to interactive & real-time applications.

## 🚀 What’s Inside / Features

- 👁️ Eye detection example (`Eyes_detector.py`)  
- ✋ Real-time finger counting / hand-gesture detection (`finger_count.py`)  
- 🔊 Volume control with gesture (e.g. hand/wrist movement) (`volume_control.py`)  
- 🦖 Fun mini-project: “Dino game” (or some playful demo) (`dino_game.py`)  
- 🎨 Sample images used for testing / demonstration (`cactus.png`, `dino.png`)
